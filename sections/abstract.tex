  Recursive domain equations play an important role in denotational semantics and type theory.
  In fact, they allow the definition of recursive program and, more important, recursive specification of datatypes.
  A suitable mathematical setting to describe and solve these equations is given by category theory.
  In this work, a canonical construction for solutions of least fixed point equations over categorical domains will be introduced, with a focus on a particular type of categories where morphisms do satisfy certain additional conditions.
  Namely, a brief overview of least fixed point theory for cpos and categories will be presented.
  After that, a dissertation over \(\mathbf{O}\)--categories and solution of recursive equations in such categories will be held.
  Finally, it will be shown how main features of programming languages'types fit into this framework.
