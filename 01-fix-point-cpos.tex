\section{Fixed point theory for partially ordered sets}

\begin{dfn}
  A \emph{partially ordered set} --- \emph{poset} --- is a pair
  \((C, \lhd)\), where \(C\) is a set and \({}\lhd{}\) is a binary relation
  on it which is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
\end{dfn}

In a poset \((C, {}\lhd)\), an element \(c \in C\) is a \emph{minimal}
element of \(C\) iff there isn't any \(y \in C\) different from \(x\) such
that \(y \lhd x\), and it is a \emph{least} one iff each \(y \in C\) satisfies
\(x \lhd y\).
Similarly, we can define the notions of \emph{maximal} and \emph{greatest}
elements of a poset.

\begin{dfn}
  An \(\omega{}\)-\emph{complete partial order} --- \(\omega{}\)-\emph{cpo} ---
  is a poset with a least element in which every ascending \(\omega{}\)-chain
  has a least upper bound in it.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}
  Let \((C, {}<)\) and \((C^\prime, {}\lhd)\) be posets.
  A function \(f \colon C \to C^\prime\) is \emph{monotonic} iff
  \[
    \forall x,y \in C.\, x \lhd y \implies f(x) \lhd f(y).
  \]
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}
  Let \(C\) and \(C^\prime\) be \(\omega{}\)-cpos.
  A function \(f \colon C \to C^\prime\) is \(\omega{}\)-\emph{continuous}
  iff it is monotonic and, for each ascending \(\omega{}\)-chain
  \(\lbrace x_i \rbrace_{i=0}^\infty\) in \(C\),
  \[
  f\left(\bigcup_{i=0}^\infty x_i\right) = \bigcup_{i=0}^\infty f(x_i).
  \]
\end{dfn}
